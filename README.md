# School_District_Analysis
## Overview 
### Initial Analysis
An analysis was performed in Jupyter Notebook on reading and math scores for schools in the Py City School District (found in the PyCitySchools.ipynb file). In the intiial analysis of the school district a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics we created Pandas dataframes for the following metrics: the top five top and bottom performing schools based on overall passing ( math and reading school >= 70 ) rate, the average math score received by students in each grade level at each school, the average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school, school performance based on the budget per student, school performance based on the school size,  and school performance based on the type of school.
### Challenge Anlysis
Academic dishonesty was reported to the school board which revelaed alteration to Thomas High School ninth-grade math and readiing scores. For the challenge analysis we were tasked to replace the ninth grade math and reading scores with NaN's while keeping the rest of the data intact and repeat the school dustrict analysis and descirbe how the initial metrics were affected. 
## Results 
How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type
## Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
